# Approach for the project 

1. Data Ingestion : 
    * In Data Ingestion phase the data is first read as csv. 
    * Then the data is split into training and testing and saved as csv file.

2. Data Transformation : 
    * In this phase a ColumnTransformer Pipeline is created.
    * for Numeric Variables first SimpleImputer is applied with strategy median , then Standard Scaling is performed on numeric data.
    * for Categorical Variables SimpleImputer is applied with most frequent strategy, then ordinal encoding performed , after this data is scaled with Standard Scaler.
    * This preprocessor is saved as pickle file.

3. Model Training : 
    * In this phase base model is tested . The best model found was catboost regressor.
    * After this hyperparameter tuning is performed on catboost and knn model.
    * A final VotingRegressor is created which will combine prediction of catboost, xgboost and knn models.
    * This model is saved as pickle file.

4. Prediction Pipeline : 
    * This pipeline converts given data into dataframe and has various functions to load pickle files and predict the final results in python.

5. Flask App creation : 
    * Flask app is created with User Interface to predict the gemstone prices inside a Web Application.
